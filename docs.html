    <h3 id="Keyboard_Shortcuts"><a href="#Keyboard_Shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h3>
    <p>Libredirect offers the following Keyboard shortcuts for easier access</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Shift+Alt+L</code> - To Switch the instance you are currently in</li>
      <li><code>Shift+Alt+C</code> - Copies the original link. Ex: Copies the original Twitter link when you are in
        Nitter website</li>
      <li><code>Shift+Alt+U</code> - Shortcut to initiate Unify Settings. In other words, Copies the preferences
        (cookies, localStorage) from the current opened instance and copy them to all the other selected instances</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="preferred_instance"><a href="#preferred_instance">Using Preferred Instance</a></h3>
    <p>In Older version of LibRedirect, There was an option called "Always Use preferred instance" which helped users to
      redirect to the instance they particularly use instead of the other instances. But it was removed due to code
      complexity and breakage it caused in the extension.</p>
    <p>If you want to use your Preferred Instance instead of other instance. Just use <code>Switch Instance</code>
      feature from the popup or use the Keyboard Shortcut to go to your preferred ones.</p>
    <p>If you don't get it, Here is an example :
    <ul>
      <li>You have set your YouTube frontend as Piped and you go to a Invidious link shared by others. Now, If you use
        <code>Switch Instance</code>, it will switch to Piped.
      </li>
      <li>You have a particular instance selected such as <a href="nitter.it">nitter.it</a> in Nitter frontend and
        receive a <a href="nitter.net">nitter.net</a> link. But you want to use nitter.it instance. When you use 'Switch
        Instance` feature, you will be redirected.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This applies for every frontend. You can use the shortcut for easier accessibility.</p>
    <p>Note that this will work only for links not Embeds.</p>
    <h3 id="exceptions"><a href="#exceptions">Understanding Exceptions</a></h3>
    <div class="align"><img src="img/docs/exceptions.webp"></div>
    <p>Exceptions as the name says for itself will exclude certain sites from being redirected.
      When you add a site to the exceptions list it will not redirect as it is excluded from redirection.</p>
    <p>This exceptions is in short a manual allowlist not a <b>blocklist</b></p>
    <h3 id="instances"><a href="#instances">Defined Instances</a></h3>
    <p> You should be able to see instances such as <x class="color-a">authenticate</x> and <x class="color-c">Cloudflare</x></p>
    <p><x class="color-a">authenticate</x> means that the instances require authentication to visit and access data in them</p>
    <p><x class="color-c">Cloudflare</x> indicates that the instances use Cloudflare as their CDN which isn't recommeneded to use as Cloudflare can 
      decrypt data between you and server to compress it and send them faster. This could also potentially means that Cloudflare
      can see data in Plain text even though the site uses HTTPS
    </p>
