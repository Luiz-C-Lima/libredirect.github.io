    <p>Bad Examples</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://pixiv.moe/" class="red">PixivMoe</a> - It wasn't
        meant to be an alternative private frontend in the first place
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.startpage.com/" class="red">Startpage</a> -
        It doesn't require automated redirections. Just set it as your
        default Search Engine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Plus, there's already an
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/startpage-private-search/">extension</a>
        for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://old.reddit.com/" class="red">Old Reddit</a> - It attempts to track/fingerprint you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://pinafore.social/" class="red">Pinafore</a> - It's a
        full featured web app for
        <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, not a frontend
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://playsoju.netlify.app/" class="red">Soju</a> - It's
        just a website that gives you samples of Spotify songs, not a
        frontend. If you want to use it, just visit their
        <a href="https://playsoju.netlify.app/">website</a> and paste the
        spotify link you want to get a sample of.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://imginn.com/" class="red">Imginn</a> - There are many trackers on the website, not

    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect">Privacy Redirect</a>
      hasn't been maintained since 6/12/2021. Many instances are hard coded.
      Some should be removed as they became offline and many others should be
      added. Many Pull Requests were left pending and waiting. So we stepped
      in. Later, we started improving it further by adding new features and
      frontends.
    </p>

    <p>Disclaimer : Even though we forked from Privacy Redirect. Libredirect is ahead of
      the main project with several improvements and new features. The Project is independent now.

    <p>Let's examine them one by one:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest">webRequest</a>,
        <y>webRequestBlocking</y>: To block <code>http</code> requests or
        redirect them. For example, to redirect to Invidious before it can
        reach YouTube's servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage">storage</a>: To
        save LibRedirect's settings permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText">Clipboard.writeText</a>
        : To write the original link to the clipboard while using Copy Raw.
        This permission is used to only write data. LibRedirect does not read
        the data in your clipboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies">cookies</a>: To
        apply settings across multiple instances. Note that we also use
        localStorage. Those options are disabled by default though.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus">menus</a>: For adding
        some buttons to the Context menu :

      <li>
        <y>&lt;all_urls&gt;</y>: LibRedirect is dynamic and customizable. The
        targets e.g <a href="https://youtube.com">youtube.com</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> are written in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regex</a>
        and are too complicated to be hard-coded in the manifest. Ex:
        <a
          href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/95d30cb3af0bd09dcc9afb5ea508a60139777812/src/assets/javascripts/search.js#L321-L394">search
          Regex</a>. Furthermore, we also need to access the instances sites to inject
        some localStorage variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/privacy">privacy</a>: To

          isolation</a>. This is important for creating cookies that the Tor Browser will
        accept. We only read and don't modify any privacy setting.

    <p>
      Almost every frontend project has a list of public instances. Examples:
      <a href="https://api.invidious.io/">Invidious' official instances list</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances">Nitter's official instances list</a>. For frontends that
      don't have an instance list, we use our own, which
      you can find under
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/LibRedirect/libredirect/src/branch/master/src/instances">src/instances</a>. We fetch
      those lists using an automated
      <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/src/instances/get_instances.py">python script</a>.
      This script gets triggered every 3 days. We don't intercept nor
      modify the lists outside of removing urls that are not valid (the
      structure is not that of a url) and removing trailing slashes. They're
      not our responsibility: they're the projects maintainers'.

      LibRedirect is just a tool. We're not here to choose for you. It's your
      own choice. The default setting selects all instances except those using
      Cloudflare, but you can change it yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can't know which instances are reputable for you and which aren't.
      Every person has a different point of view. LibRedirect should follow
      your point of view, not ours.

      We can't publish it to the Chrome Web Store as it requires Manifest v3
      and we use Manifest v2. You can still
      <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect/blob/master/chromium.md">install it manually</a>. We are
      planning to adopt Manifest v3 in Firefox as they will support
      the feature LibRedirect needs. If other browsers support Mozilla's
      policy, you might see LibRedirect in the Chrome Web Store.

    </h2>
    <p>
      This feature copies locally-stored settings such as theme, language, etc. across instances to make using multiple instances easier.
      It does not support private/incognito mode.
    </p>
    <img alt="Unify Settings button in popup menu" width="218" height="188"
         src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12092270/196612534-74138c30-a399-479e-ad5e-440dc14b406c.png">
    <p>
      To use it, visit one of your selected instances where you already have settings saved. 
      Press "Unify Settings" in the popup menu or use the keyboard shortcut <code>Shift+Alt+U</code>.
      This will copy the settings from the current instance to all your other selected instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unify Settings may behave differently for different frontends, as it depends on how each frontend saves settings.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Piped saves settings in local storage, which unifies predictably across instances.</li>
      <li>Libreddit saves settings as individual cookies, which unifies predictably across instances.</li>
      <li>Nitter saves settings as individual cookies, but only saves settings you change from an instance's default. 
        This means unifying settings can behave differently depending on which instance you unify from. Saving
        certain settings requires unifying from specific instances, and some settings combinations may require unifying 
        from multiple instances.
      <li>Invidious saves its settings in a cookie with a nonstandard URL (<code>.&lt;domain&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code>),
        so instances fail to consistently load unified settings..</li>
    </ul>
